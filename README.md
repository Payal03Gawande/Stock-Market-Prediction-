# Stock-Market-Prediction-

Hello everyone,
I'm excited to share the completion of Task 1 for the Bharat Intern Internship program. Our goal for this task was to use a special computer program called LSTM to predict whether a company's stock price would go up or down. 😊

Here's a quick summary of what I did:
**Import Libraries:** I brought in some helpful tools to work with data and create charts.

**Loading Data 🔃 : **I got the stock price data and used it for our project.

**Feature Extraction 💡 :** I picked out the important data that could help predict if the stock price would go up or down.

**Building Model 🏗 :** I created a program using LSTM, which is great at understanding patterns in data over time.

**Training Model 🎰 :** I trained my program using historical stock price data, making it better at predicting.

**Prediction Model 🤟 :** After training, my program predicted whether the stock price would go up or down.

**Plotting Results 🏜 :** I made charts and graphs to see how well my program did.


Tools Used 🔦 :
Jupyter Notebook: I used this smart notebook for writing code and looking at results.


I want to thank the Bharat Intern team for this fantastic 💐 learning opportunity. This internship has been a great experience, and I've learned a lot about predicting stock prices with computers.
